The Fraction class is a wrapper for an int pointer that points to two ints. The first int is
treated as the numerator of a fraction while the second is the denominator of the fraction.
The intention of the Fraction class is to allow for arithmetic of a division without the
potential imprecision that occurs with every floating-point calculation.
